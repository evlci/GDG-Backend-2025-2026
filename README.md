💻 GDG-Backend-Project-and-Assignments 

This repository contains my work and progress in the GDG-Backend.  
It includes weekly assignments and practice files as I learn backend development step by step.  
The goal of this repo is to track my learning journey and build a solid foundation in backend technologies.
